				<p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating.
				 manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or a non -relational database. Relationships means a set of ourdata is related to another section of our data. Meanwhile  in  a non databases are put into sections of data called schemas. inside each scheme each data set is organized into tables, those tables contain columns and rows to house that piticular set of data.
